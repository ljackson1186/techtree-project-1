        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Though I do not have any relative experience in dealing with creating websites from scratch, I do have experience in the tech field. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in cybersecurity and look forward to completing it.</p>
        <p>My experience as a police officer taught me to adapt, overcome, and succeed in nearly every situation that I am placed in.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy traveling with my wife. We have been to many different countries and states around the USA, and only plan to visit more. Traveling has made me appreciate different cultures, but also the freedoms that we enjoy here in America. It has broadened my world view and truly given me inspiration for what I would like to do in life.</p>
        <p>We do not travel as often as we used to however, because in 2018, my wife gave birth to our first child, and out lives have changed forever.</p>
        <p>Other than traveling, I enjoy reading a good book (mostly non-fiction) and playing videogames when the time calls for it.</p>
